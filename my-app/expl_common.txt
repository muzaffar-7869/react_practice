Main pgm will be written in app.js
react uses functions not classes
in functions we use return function (its common in all lang.)
we use paranthesis () to use jsx
react uses JSX means its combination of htlm & js

html tags & methods replaced with these in jsx {
class: className
for: htmlFor
}

js will always written in: { }

<h1> use for heading
The <nav> tag defines a set of navigation links.

The <li> tag in HTML is used to define the list of items in an HTML document.

The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.

HTML <p> tag defines the paragraph and is used to give structure to text content within a webpage.
in <p> tag type loren34 + tab_button: create sample paragraph

write in app.jss:
<tag className="blank"> </tag> //tag can be h1,div,p,li,etc. 
so write in App.css:
.blank{
  color: rgb(0, 173, 107);
}


declare any varible of js outside of function
e.g let name= "Mujjo";  
can be use in html tags with { }
e.g: <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
